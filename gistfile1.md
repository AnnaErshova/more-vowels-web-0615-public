Let's go back to the exercise where we determined what is and isn't a vowel. With ruby, there's always more than one way to do something and get the same result.

Assuming vowels `a,e,i,o,u`:

1. Write a method that returns whether a given letter is a vowel, using `if` and `elsif`
2. Write a method that returns whether a given letter is a vowel, using `case`
3. Write a method that returns whether a given letter is a vowel, using `if` with no `else`, all on a single line
4. Write a method that returns whether a given letter is a vowel without using `if` or `case` while all on a single line
5. Write a method that returns whether a given letter is a vowel without checking equality, or the use of `if`, using the array of vowels
6. Write a method that will evaluate a string and return the first vowel found in the string, if any
7. Write a method that will evaluate a string and return the ordinal position (index) of the string where the first vowel is found, if any

*hint: remember that every line of ruby code has a return value, and that a method will return the result of the last operation*
